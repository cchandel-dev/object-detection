ok so this works ... kind of...
when the mAP > 0.9, we stop training but that happened really quickly...
I didn't like that
I turned that off and got the loss below 4 after training for the whole night, the results weren't terrible tbh.
I think I need to get rid of the healthy samples, for the next implementation.

ran into 2 issues simultaneously, not sure why saving the model was breaking and not sure why mAP crossed 0.9 so fast.

Use pickle to save and load the model
