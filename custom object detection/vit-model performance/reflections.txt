10-> increased patch size  and realllly boosted the accuracy (class and IoU)
9->reduced the number of projected dims to 8 and class predicitions look even nicer!
8-> reduced the number of projected dims to 16 and class predicitions somehow got fixed!
7-> custom dataset works!
5->0: more transorfmer layer gives a little accuracy boost
4->3: reduced the patch size + halved projection + increase heads, huge amount of time per epoch but a signifcant increase in accuracy.
3->0: reduced the patch size + halved projection, decent accuracy
2->0: reduced projection dim from 64 to 32, thereby speeding up each epoch, reducing the the number of epochs till convergence and slightly improving accuracy.
1->0: increased number of heads from 4 to 8, thereby reducing convergence time and
